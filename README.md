# Crypto

Welcome to my repository of cryptography notes! As I learn new concepts and techniques, I will do my best to outline them here and make it as intuitive as possible.

A lot of the maths referenced here is mentioned in my [Maths blog](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/mathematics/), where I'll be putting anything that is more "generic" than cryptography-related.
