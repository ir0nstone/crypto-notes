# Divisibility, Factors and Euclid's Algorithms

Cryptography is built on the foundations of algebra and number theory, which we will hopefully cover well enough here.

## Divisibility

$$a$$ is said to be divisible by $$b$$ if there is another integer $$c$$ such that $$a=bc$$. In this case, $$b$$ is said to be a **factor** of $$c$$. This is denoted by $$a \mid b$$ if $$a$$ divides $$b$$, and $$a \nmid b$$ if it does not.
