# Homomorphisms

A homomorphism between groups $$(G,*)$$ and $$(H,\diamond)$$ is a function $$f$$ that maps an element of $$G$$​ onto elements of $$H$$​ while **preserving the group structure**.

$$
f: G \mapsto H
$$

The point of a homomorphism is to highlight **similarities in structure**. When we talk about preserving the group structure, we mean that the elements of $$H$$ that our chosen elements of $$G$$​ map onto follow the same pattern using the group operation. Essentially, $$f$$​is a homomorphism if

$$
f(x * y) = f(x) \diamond f(y)
$$

​If we take the result of the the operation of $$x,y \in G$$​ and find the corresponding element it maps to in $$H$$​, this is the equivalent to mapping $$x,y$$​ to $$H$$​ then using the operation of $$H$$​ on the results.

## Isomorphism

An isomorphism is a homomorphism $$f$$ that is **bijective**. Bijective means that it is both **surjective** and **injective**.

**Surjective** means that for every $$y$$ there exists an $$x$$​ such that \$$
